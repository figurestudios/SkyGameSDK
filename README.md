# SkyPeers
> developed for the ENCODE and the Built to Explore hackathons.

> With SkyPeers, you can connect to friends through multiplayer games.

> Perfect for non-realtime games where you want turn-based trustless updates.

# Inner workings
SkyPeers work through MySky, SkyDB, and SkyNet;
MySky is used for login, finding peers and saving configurations,
SkyDB is used for multiplayer data - and SkyNet can be used here to upload larger files.

# Setup // TODO

# License // TODO

# Potential additions // TODO(partly)
* Real-time connections(might require websockets, as not everyone can connect with P2P without TURN/STUN servers)
* Working demo
